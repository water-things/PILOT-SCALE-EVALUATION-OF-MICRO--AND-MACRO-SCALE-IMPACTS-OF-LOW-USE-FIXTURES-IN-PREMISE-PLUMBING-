# Raw data and python script for RBP system labeled accordingly~
# "250418 Exp_2 updated v3.py" is the general python script used for valve control and data collection (read header)
# "E2aSched.csv" is the usage pattern which can be adjusted 
# E_ID and R_ID are experiment and replicate identifiers
# Experiment 1 grab sample data labeled "E1_X.csv" where X corresponds to use in min/hr
# Experiment 2 grab sample data labeled "E2_X.csv" where X corresponds to flow rate in %
# Experiment 2 grab sample data contains both E2a and E2b data, delineated by E_ID in the .csv files
# Experiment 2 online sensor data labeled "E2_X_Y.csv" where X corresponds to flow rate, and Y corresponds to experiment,
# Y = A1 is Experiment 2a replicate 1, A2 is Experiment 2a replicate 2, and C is Experiment 2b
